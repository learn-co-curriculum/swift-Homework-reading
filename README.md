5. Read the following chapter (after Properties) titled Methods [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Methods.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH15-ID234).
6. Write a blog post titled "Value types & Reference types", providing details as to the difference between the two. Providing actual examples in code in your blog would be perfect!
